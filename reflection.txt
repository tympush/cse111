Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

I saw the power of functions a lot throughout the various assignments that we've had.
But it all culminated with our final project, as it was the biggest program we've had 
to write, using a lot of functions. It really showed me how useful functions are, and 
how easier they make writing programs if you use them correctly.

2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

Test functions allow you to test the functionality of various functions from your program.
Test functions aren't ideal for all sorts of functions, but for those that can be tested, 
test function are a great way to quickly and more easily test those functions.
You can pass different parameters to test the program thoroughly, which is easier and faster 
than running the program and manually performing different inputs.

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

To troubleshoot, I usually first add temporary lines of code to my program to see a bit 
more behind the scenes, like printing a list midway through a process. I may then try a 
couple different things like play around with different inputs to find the exact issue.
If the problem is large and severe, I will make a test function to conduct better testing.
I'm not really in a habit of using the VSCode debugging feature, which is something that 
I could improve.
